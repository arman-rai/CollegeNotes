CSC 169 Statistics I note (pure nepali dekhine sir) 

### Descriptive Statistics Overview
- **Purpose**: Describe and summarize data meaningfully.
- **Does not**: Allow conclusions beyond analyzed data.

### Types of Analysis
1. **Univariate Analysis**: Examines one variable (e.g., age).
   - Focus: Description
2. **Bivariate Analysis**: Examines two variables simultaneously (e.g., relationship between gender and height).
   - Focus: Empirical relationship between two variables
3. **Multivariate Analysis**: Examines more than two variables simultaneously (e.g., relationship among gender, caste, and height).
   - Focus: Empirical relationship among multiple variables

### Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics
- **Descriptive Statistics**: 
  - Describe and summarize data.
  - Initial step in data analysis for understanding data distribution.
- **Inferential Statistics**:
  - Make predictions/inferences about a population from a sample.
  - Generalize results to a larger population.

### Key Concepts in Univariate Analysis
- **Frequency Distribution**: Snapshot of a variable's values.
- **Central Tendency Measures**:
  - **Mean**: Average value.
  - **Median**: Middle value.
  - **Mode**: Most frequent value.
- **Dispersion Measures**:
  - **Range**: Difference between highest and lowest values.
  - **Variance**: Average of squared deviations from the mean.
  - **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance.

### Measurement Scales
- **Nominal Scale**: Categories without order (e.g., gender, nationality).
  - Analysis: Frequency, percentage, mode.
- **Ordinal Scale**: Ordered categories (e.g., education level, rating).
  - Analysis: Frequency, percentage, mode, median.
- **Interval Scale**: Quantitative values with arbitrary zero (e.g., temperature).
  - Analysis: Mean, median, t-test, f-test.
- **Ratio Scale**: Quantitative values with a true zero (e.g., weight, height).
  - Analysis: Mean, median, t-test, f-test, correlation.

### Central Tendency and Dispersion
- **When to use**:
  - **Nominal Data**: Mode
  - **Ordinal Data**: Mode and/or median
  - **Interval/Ratio Data**: Mean, median, and/or mode
- **Standard Deviation**:
  - Indicates spread and consistency.
  - Sensitive to outliers.

### Visual Representation
- **Frequency Distribution**:
  - Tabular or graphical (bar charts, pie charts, line charts).

### Normal Distribution
- **Tests**:
  - **Shapiro-Wilk Test**: Suitable for small to moderate-sized datasets.
  - **Visual Inspection**: For larger datasets using histograms or Q-Q plots.

### Shapiro-Wilk Test in SPSS
1. Analyze → Descriptive Statistics → Explore.
2. Move variables to "Dependent List".
3. Plots → Check "Normality plots with tests".
4. Continue → OK.
5. Interpret p-value:
   - p > 0.05: Data is normally distributed (fail to reject null hypothesis).
